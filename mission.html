            <h2>Propogate Self-Awareness Among <br>
                People Regarding Water Consumption <br>
                And Manage Their Water Bill</h2>
            <p>We all know that water is of utmost important in this over populating world. <br> According to the latest
                data available from the Ministry of Jal Shakti, <br> Government of India, the total water consumption in
                India in the year 2017 <br> was 634 billion cubic meters (BCM).
                <br> <br> Out of this, the agricultural sector consumed the most water, accounting <br> for 83% of the total
                consumption, while the industrial and domestic sectors <br> accounted for 5% and 12% respectively.
                It is important to note that water <br> consumption patterns in India can vary widely depending on the
                region and the availability of water resources. Some regions of the country face acute water
                scarcity, while others have an abundance of water resources.</p>

                    <p>Water is inextricably linked to the development of all nations. <br> But unsustainable development
                        is placing pressure on water <br> resources: by 2030, global demand for water is expected to <br>
                        increase by 50%. Meanwhile,agriculture (which consumes around <br> 70% of global
                        water usage) is expected to experience a 70% <br> increase in demand by 2050.</p>

                    <p>Our aim at
                        DISTIL is to ensure availability and sustainable <br> management of water and sanitation for all.
                        Access to safe water, <br> sanitation and hygiene is the most basic human need for health <br> and
                        well-being.
                        Knowing the fact that in many countries there is a <br> lack of water, an attempt is made by us
                        here to make the complex <br> topic of sustainability understandable and practical by creating
                        <br> awareness.</p>
